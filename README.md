Learning the basics of OpenGL using a combination of the websites [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com), [opengl-tutorial](www.opengl-tutorial.org), and YouTube videos by [TheCherno](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2). The goal is to learn enough OpenGL to be able to implement visualization for some computational physics projects.

To add source code for a new section run the script to make a new folder with a folder name as the argument

````
./folder.sh test
````

will make a new folder named test containing the files `test.cc`, `Makefile`, `fragment.shader`, and `vertex.shader`. You can then run the make file to compile and run the program

````
cd test
make run
````
